## About the Project
This system utilizes a Random Forest classifier to categorize patients into two groups:
1.  **Short Stay:** 0-10 Days
2.  **Long Stay:** >10 Days

Beyond simple prediction, the system provides **Explainable AI (XAI)** insights, explaining *why* a specific prediction was made based on vital signs and department statistics.

### Key Features
* **Vital Signs Triage:** Automatic risk assessment based on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate (Extreme/Moderate/Stable).
* **AI Prediction Engine:** High-accuracy classification using Random Forest.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** User-friendly Web UI built with Streamlit.
* **Smart Insights:** Dynamic alerts for critical cases (e.g., Trauma or Surgery risks).
